 * Version 2.0
 *	- January 04, 2015
 *	- New system, supporting OneWire library 2.0
 *
 * Version 1.1
 *	- December 06, 2014
 *	- Now CRC is calculated and checked if data are valid
 *	- New version of OneWire library is required, download already available on stm32f4-discovery.com
 *
 * With this you can read temperature, set and get temperature resolution from 9 to 12 bits
 * and check if device is DS18B20
 * 
 * Pin for STM32F4xx is the same as set with TM ONEWIRE library.
