 * 
 * Version 2.1
 *	- March 10, 2015
 *	- Added support for my GPIO library 
 *
 * Version 2.0
 * 	- January 04, 2015
 *	- New OneWire system
 *	- With support for multiple OneWire ports to separate group of devices
 *
 * Version 1.1
 *	- December 06, 2014
 *	- Added 8-bit CRC calculation for 1-Wire devices, algorythm from Dallas
 *
 * As of version 2.0 you can now use more than just one one-wire "port" on STM32F4.
 * This allows you to group devices to separate ports.
 * Because if you have a loot devices on one port, if one device fail, everything is failed.
 * You can prevent this by use more than just one port.
